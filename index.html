              <h3>Shoot First</h3>
              <p>
                This was a third person shooter game I developed for university. I received a 1st for this project. The aim of the game is to survive until the timer runs out and the win screen is shown. Waves of enemies spawn in throughout this time which the player can either hide from or kill with the assault rifle they have.
                During this project I used Unreal Engine 5 and blueprinting to create the game. The models and animations were downloaded from Mixamo and the environments were created using free assets from the Unreal Marketplace. However, all of the behaviour and logic of the game was created by me personally. I made use of behaviour trees for the enemy AI which made a strong system that worked in tandem with the animation blueprints I made. Also, the way I made the enemies made them be able to navigate the map and also detect the player seemlessly.
                In order to make a shooting mechanic I used line traces to detect if the player had hit an enemy or not. I also implemented a health system for both the player and the enemies which would trigger death animations and remove the enemy from the game when their health reached 0.
                Overall, I enjoyed making this project and I am proud of the final result. Shown below is a short demo video from the game.

              <h3>Orbital Onslaught</h3>
              <p>
                This was a group project I worked on at university. The game is a first person shooter that incorporates elements of tower defence.
                The player is stranded on a planet and must defend their space ship from waves of alien enemies. The player shoots the enemies to kill them where they can drop money which the player can use to buy different weapons and also abilites.
                There is also an upgrade which gives health back to the ship. The playe must defeat all the waves in order to win the game. In this project I worked on the rocket launcher weapon and also made all of the enemies.
                They were my main contribution to the project however I also helped with other parts of the game such as the UI and the animations.
                Again, in this project Unreal Engine 5 was used to develop the game.

              <h3>Adventure of Andy</h3>
              <p>
                This was a solo project I worked on using the Unity Engine. This meant it was all programmed using C# scripts. The game is a top down 2D adventure game.
                The game follows a player, known as Andy, as he travels throughout different levels collecting coins and killing enemies. The main systems I worked on in this project were a health system, shooting system and also a coin collection system.
                The health system would keep track of the players health and when it hits zero it will take the player to the game over screen. This will allow them to restart the current level, return to the main menu or close the game completely.
                The menu system of the game was quite challenging to make but I managed to make it fully functional with all the buttons working correctly.
                The shooting system allows the player to shoot projectiles at enemies to kill them.
                I also have a score system which tracks the score of the player in each level. Collecting coins and killing enemies will increase the score. When the player beats the game the scores for each level will be shown on the final victory screen.
